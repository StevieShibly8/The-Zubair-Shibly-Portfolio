            <h3>Welcome to My Story</h3>
            <p>
              Hi, I’m
              <mark>Zubair Shibly</mark>, and this is the place where I share my
              journey—both the milestones and the quiet moments that have shaped
              who I am today. From my early years growing up in
              <mark>Dhaka, Bangladesh</mark>, to my adventures studying abroad
              in Canada, I’ve always been driven by curiosity, passion, and a
              desire to grow. Here, you’ll find stories from my life, lessons
              I’ve learned, and insights into what drives me forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I’m passionate
              about a variety of things. I’m an avid football fan and enjoy
              following both the sport and its community. In my downtime, you
              can catch me watching anime or getting lost in movies and TV shows
              that inspire new ways of thinking. I also have a deep interest in
              physics and love exploring how the universe works on both a macro
              and micro level.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m constantly fascinated by new technologies and artificial
              intelligence, and I’m always eager to stay up to date with the
              latest developments in these fields. Whether I’m coding, studying,
              or diving into the latest tech innovations, I believe in staying
              curious and always pushing myself to learn something new. This
              site is a glimpse into my experiences, challenges, and
              achievements. Thanks for stopping by and being part of this
              journey with me.

              <h3>Middle School & High School</h3>
              <p>
                I spent the majority of my youth at
                <mark>DPS STS School</mark>, now known as
                <mark>Glenrich International School</mark>, a place that shaped
                much of who I am today. From grade 5 to 12, this school was my
                second home. It was here that my passions truly took root. My
                love for Physics and STEM—two fields that continue to inspire
                me—blossomed within its walls. Whether I was engrossed in a
                lesson or tinkering with something new, that environment
                nurtured my curiosity and pushed me to explore.

              <p>
                But it wasn't all academics. When I wasn’t in class, you could
                find me at the outdoor court, playing soccer with friends who’ve
                become lifelong companions. The friendships I built there,
                forged on the field and in the classroom, remain strong, and
                they played a vital role in making me the person I am today.
              </p>
              <p>
                My time at DPS wasn’t just about learning from books—it was
                about shaping my future. Those years taught me about
                determination, teamwork, and the pursuit of my passions, lessons
                I carry with me every day. Looking back, it's impossible not to
                feel a deep sense of nostalgia for those moments, those
                friendships, and the experiences that set me on the path I’m on
                now.

              <h3>University</h3>
              <p>
                My university years at
                <mark
                  >Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson
                  University)</mark
                >
                were transformative. It was here that I delved deeper into my
                chosen field of study, surrounded by like-minded individuals and
                inspiring professors. The rigorous academic environment pushed
                me to excel and think critically.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the highlights of my university experience was
                participating in co-op programs, where I gained hands-on
                experience working in
                <mark>Software Development</mark>
                with companies like
                <mark>Soti</mark>
                and
                <mark>Dayforce</mark>. These opportunities allowed me to apply
                theoretical knowledge to real-world projects, enhancing my
                skills and deepening my understanding of the industry. The
                experience not only bolstered my technical abilities but also
                fueled my passion for creating innovative solutions to complex
                problems.
              </p>

                As I enter my final year at TMU, I can’t help but reflect on the
                incredible journey it has been. The challenges, the friendships,
                and the countless lessons have all contributed to my growth,
                both personally and professionally. While this chapter of my
                life is nearing its end, I know the experiences and connections
                I’ve made here will continue to shape my future. The excitement
                of what lies ahead is fueled by everything I’ve learned and the
                memories I’ve created along the way.
